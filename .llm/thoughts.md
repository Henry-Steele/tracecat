## Implementing Presigned Download URL Feature

I've implemented a new method in the ObjectStore class to generate presigned URLs for downloading objects from MinIO:

```python
async def generate_presigned_download_url(
    self, ref: ObjectRef, expires_in_seconds: int = 3600
) -> str:
```

### Design choices:

1. **Input parameter**: The method takes an `ObjectRef` as input since that's the reference system used throughout the codebase.

2. **Expiration time**: Included a configurable expiration time with a reasonable default of 1 hour (3600 seconds).

3. **Validation**: The method validates that the object exists before generating the URL using a HEAD request, which is more efficient than a full GET request.

4. **S3 compatibility**: Used the standard S3 client's `generate_presigned_url` method which should work for both MinIO and AWS S3.

5. **Logging**: Added appropriate logging to track URL generation.

### How this will work with a FastAPI route:

A FastAPI route handler would:

1. Obtain the ObjectRef for the requested file
2. Call this method to generate the presigned URL
3. Return the URL in the response
4. The frontend can then use this URL to download the file directly

The benefit of this approach is that the file download happens directly between the browser and MinIO, without going through the application server, which is more efficient for large files.
